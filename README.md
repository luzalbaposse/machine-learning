# ðŸ“š Exercises and course notes | Machine Learning (8,330,1.00) â€“ Spring 2025 - HSG

This repository contains my assignments and notes for the **Machine Learning (MiQEF)** course at the University of St. Gallen, Spring 2025.  

## Course Overview  
This course covers fundamental and advanced topics in machine learning, including:  
- **Statistical Learning**: Decision theory, loss functions, empirical risk minimization  
- **Supervised Learning**: Regression, classification, neural networks, ensemble methods  
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering, dimensionality reduction  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Multi-armed bandits and selected techniques  

We will implement algorithms, analyze data, and develop a deeper understanding of machine learning theory and applications.
